## Dialogue System

In this project I made a Dialogue System that can easily being transferred to another project. I made this in Unity2D with C# language.

## Features
- Dialoge System
- Player Movement
- Camera Follow Player

## Software Analysis 
For this project I was allowed to use Unity or Javascript so I started looking at looking which language supports a dialoge system better. Right from the start I noticed that Unity had better support and easier implementation for a dialogue system. So I choose for unity

## Learning Goals 
- I want to learn how to make the foundation of a dialogue system
- I want to learn how to make the dialoge system interresting
- I want to learn the best way of making a dialoge system
- I want to learn how to make the dialoge system as efficient as possible
